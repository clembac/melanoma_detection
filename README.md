# Melanoma Detection Pierre Fabre Challenge 


## Context : 

This project has been done for the Melanoma Detection - Pierre Fabre. 
I've reached the 5th position with a simple VGG-16 and data preparation based 
on demartologic rules ABCDE

## ABCDE rule

### A - Asymmetrical Shape

Melanoma lesions are often irregular, or not symmetrical, in shape. Benign moles are usually symmetrical.


### B - Border
Typically, non-cancerous moles have smooth, even borders. Melanoma lesions usually have irregular borders that are difficult to define.

 	
### C - Color
The presence of more than one color (blue, black, brown, tan, etc.) or the uneven distribution of color can sometimes be a warning sign of melanoma. Benign moles are usually a single shade of brown or tan.

 	
###  D - Diameter
Melanoma lesions are often greater than 6 millimeters in diameter (approximately the size of a pencil eraser).



### E - Evolution
The evolution of your mole(s) has become the most important factor to consider when it comes to diagnosing a melanoma. Knowing what is normal for YOU could save your life. If a mole has gone through recent changes in color and/or size, bring it to the attention of a dermatologist immediately.
